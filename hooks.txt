Hooks:
---------

1) Hooks was introduced in React in version 16.8
2) It allow you to use state and other features without writting a class.
3) It does not work inside the class.
4) Hooks should always be used on the top level of the react function


In class componenet we use to use state BUt in functional componenet we use hooks as a state.

useState basically give us array of 2 object.

1) state object 
2) update function



reffer app3.js 



const App=()=>{
  //  const state = useState();

//    console.log(state); //It will throw a error it shoud be called inside the component
    
    const [num,setNum] = useState(0)
    
    function IncNum(){
        setNum(num+1)
    console.log('clicked');
    }


    return(<React.Fragment>
        <h1 className='heading_style'>{num}</h1>
        <button onClick={IncNum}>click me</button>
    </React.Fragment>)
}
