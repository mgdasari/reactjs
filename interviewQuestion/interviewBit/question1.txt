Q) What is virtual dom?
>>Virtual dom is a concept where virtual representation of dom is kept inside the memory.And it is synced by a actual dom by a library called as ReactDom.

Q) Why was virtual dom introduced?

>>
1) DOM manipulation is integratl part of any application and it is quite slow when compared to other javascript operation.
2) For a small change also eniter DOM Need to be updated.

Q) how does virtual dom works?
-------------------------------
>>
1) In react we have virtual dom and real dom.
2) The only difference is that all the changes are made to virtual before made to real dom.
3) The virtual dom has 2 vitual dom. One maintain the cirrent state and other main revious state.
4) So when the virtual dom is update the different between 2 virtual dom give the update changes and that difference is made to real dom using a library ReactDOM.

Q) difference between controlled and uncontrolled component?

>>controlled and uncontrolled are different approach for handling input in reactjs

controlled component:
-----------------------
1) In controlled component the value of input element is controlled by React.
2) we store the state of input element inside the code, and by using event based callback any changes made to input element will be refelect to code.So whenever a user eneter a data in input element the onchange method is triggered and that data is available for processing.
3)

function FormValidation(props) {
 let [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

 let updateInput = e => {
   setInputValue(e.target.value);
 };

 return (
   <div>
     <form>
       <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={updateInput} />
     </form>
   </div>
 );
}


uncontrolled component:
------------------------
1) In uncontrolled component the value of input element is controlled by dom.
2) The state of input element is handled by dom.
3) whenever user enter the data, it shown directly.To access this data we use ref 

The only difference betwen 

With controlled component you can do processing based on state.

With uncontrolled component you can not do processing based on state.
