There are many way you can optimize the react app.

1) using useMemo():
---------------------

It is React Hooks that is used for caching CPU-extensive function.

In react app sometime cpu extensive function are called repeatedly due to re-render of a component.which can lead to slow rendering.

Use of useMemo hooks cache this such functions.

2)using React.pureComponents:
-----------------------------

It is a base component which check states and props before updating a component.

Instead of using simple ReactComponent use React.pureComponent which will reduce the unneccessary re-render of component.

3) Maintaining a state colocation:
-----------------------------------
Having a too many state in componet can lead to unneccessary re-render ooof component.Better move all the states which are les value to parent component, to separate component.

4) Lazy Loading:
-------------------
It is technique used to reduce the load time of react app.Lazy loading help to reduce the risk of web app performance.

Q) What are keys in React.js?
--------------------------------
>> use Array.map()

1) Avoid using a for loop
2) give each item a unqiue keys
3) Avoid using array index as the key.


***) When you are dealing with list of element then keys are used.

const ids=[1,2,3,4,5]
const listElement=ids.map((id)=>{
    return(
        <li> key = {id.tostring()}</li>
    )
})
