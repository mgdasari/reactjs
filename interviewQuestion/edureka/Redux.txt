Q) Redux:

>> Redux is basically a library which governs the flow of the data in unidirectional.

Q) How redux works?
>> To understand this lets discuss and example.

If people want to change any law they have to do below things.

1) people
2) protest
3) law
4) minster
5) propose in parlianment
6) Update to news channels
7) From news channel it get back to people for follow.

Same way redux also work in same  flow.

1) component
2) dispatch the changes
3) actions
4) Reducers,It can be one or many
5) central store
6) trigger,subscription,passes updated state as propose
7) back to component

Q) What are the 3 principle that redux follow?

>>First principle (Single source of truth:):
-----------------------------------------------
The state of whole aplication is stored in one object within store object.

Second principle (state is read-only:):
----------------------------------------
The only way to change the state is emit an action describing what is a change.

If you want to update the state of ur application you need to know the redux with an action.You can do it directly.

Third principle (Changes are made with pure functions:):
----------------------------------------------------------

How the state is transformed by action is governed by a third principle.For this you write a Reducers.

Reducers is a pure function which take previousState and action as input and output  newState.

Q) What do you understand by Single source of truth ?
>>This means that application stores all the states of application at one point in Single object stored object.


Q) List down the component in redux?
>>
1) Actions
2) Reducers
3) stores
4) view

Q) HOw the data flows through redux?
>>1) whenever user want to change any thing. This intended change goes to action 
2) Action triggers an event.
3) The reducers get previous state from store and actionType fromm actions.
4) It give new state which are stored in store
5) as shown a state got changed the page is re-rendered again and display the changes.
