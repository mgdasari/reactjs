Q) Is everything in react is component ?
>> component are the building blocks of the react. Entire UI is splitted into independent component.
Each independent componet are rendered independently without affecting the UI.

Q) What is the purpose of render()?
>>
1) render() method basically returns a react element which is a representation of the native DOM.
2) Each componet must have render method.
3) If you have a multiple element in component then you need to group with enclosing tag like <form>,<group>,<div>

Q) How can you embed 2-3 more component?
>>
class MyComponent extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return(          
             
<div>               
<h1>Hello</h1>
                <Header/>
            </div>
 
        );
    }
}
class Header extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return
 
<h1>Header Component</h1>
   
   };
}
ReactDOM.render(
    <MyComponent/>, document.getElementById('content')
);

Q) What are props?
>>
1) props are the properties in react.If you want to send properties to any component you use props.
2) props are immutable.
3) They are always passed from parents to child component.A child component can not send props back to parent component.

Q) What is state ?
>>1) States are basically heart of the reactjs
2) states are mutuable.
3) states are the source of the data which can determine component behaviour and rendering.
4) They are accessed via this.state

Q) Difference between states and props?
>>                                                         state         props
Receive initial value from parent component                 yes          yes
parent component can change value                           no           yes
set default values inside the component                     yes         yes
changes inside the component                                yes         no
set initial value for child component                       yes         yes

Q) How can u update the state of component?
>>By this.state method

Q) What are the arrow funtion in React ?
>> Arrow function allow to bind a context of the component properly.

without arrow function:
-----------------------
render(){
    return <h1 onchange={this.handleChange.bind(this)}/>
}
with arrow function:
--------------------------
render(){
    return <h1 onchange={(e)=>{this.handleChange(e)}}/>
}


Q) Difference between statefull and stateless component?
>>
Statefull Component:
------------------------

1) It stores the information about the states inside the memory.
2) Have authority to change the state
3) contains the knowledge of current, past and future states.
4) stateless component notify them about the requirement of state changes.

Stateless Component:
---------------------
1) calculate the internal state of the component.
2) Do not have the authority to change the state.
3) contains no knowledge of past current and future states.
4) They receive the props from statefull component and treat them as a callback.

Q) What are different phases of component?

>>1) initial phases:This phase is when component start its journey and make it way towards DOM

2) updating phase: Once the Component is added to the DOM.It can potentially update and re-render when props and state get changed.That happens in this phase.

3) Unmounting:This is the final phase of the component in which it is destroyed.
