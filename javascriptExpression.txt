import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

let flname = 'mukund dasari'

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hi myname in name is flname</h1>
  
  ,document.getElementById('root'));



Here in the index.js file we are using JSX element. But if you want to do some javascript in JSX then you have to use JSX expression.

you just have to add {} and do the javascript in the curly braces.

Below is the example.

Example1:
---------

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

let flname = 'mukund dasari'

ReactDOM.render(
  <>

  <h1>Hi myname in name is {flname }</h1>
  </>
  
  ,document.getElementById('root'));


Example2:
----------

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

let flname = 'mukund dasari'

ReactDOM.render(
<div>
<h1>Hi myname in name is {flname}</h1>
<h2>score is {Math.random()}</h2>
<h3>Average is {100+200}</h3>

</div>
  
  ,document.getElementById('root'));


NOTE:
---------

In {} curly braces you can only use expression not statements.

statements as in ifelse statement etc.
